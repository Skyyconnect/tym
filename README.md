An engine for time modeling.

moment.js, level.db, vanilla js

This engine is written in vanilla js, meaning that we used the simpliest forms of javascript so that is it readable to anyone.
We didnt want to add any tricks to the engines core. 
The vanilla js used in the engine is purposeful in design.
