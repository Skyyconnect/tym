Based on what you think can be encoded we will figure out how to pre or post filter the operation to select for the other query parameters.
 
Some Assumptions
An individual, Jill, has a unified calendar U which encodes all free/busy information
An individual Jill, has a service calendar S which encodes all free/busy information for her hair services, service calendar B for her barbering classes , and service calendar P for her personal appointments
An individual Jill has single appointments of some duration and on a specific date and time that when added create the free/busy information (service related ones sum to a service calendar S or B and personal to her personal calendar P, when then sum to her total free/busy)… so Jill total free/busy = P + S + B
 
Ideally we can encode the following in the chronosphere or have the timekeeper know how to filter on data from our user database in a second pass or as a feed in to make the following possible:
Service (a service calendar like woodworking or tutoring)
Provider location (geography like Berkeley, CA) and distance ( we will have the Lat/Long coordinates for their city class somewhere unless we can encode in vector/frequency space as well)
Availability (free and busy intervals) and ability to generate start times
 
The most restrictive query being something like “find all math tutors free for 60 min within 5 miles of the city center of Palo Alto, CA within the next two weeks and return the start times of this 60 min lesson)
 
Find all appointments for user X (one or many user IDs, IDs with service filter )
Return a list of Jill’s appointments (all)
Return a list of Jill and Chris’ appointments (for all hair appointments of superclass X but none of her other services)
Return a list of Jill’s appointments (men’s haircuts of service class X )
 
Find all free time for user X (one or many user IDs)
Return a list of Jill’s empty time blocks
Return a list of Jill and Jack’s empty time blocks
 
Find all jointly available free time for user X and Y (could be many IDs)
Return the free time blocks for a union of Jack and Jill
 
Return all start times for an appointment that has duration N (in minutes) with time objects X (time IDs of individuals or other time assets involved)
Return start times for a 30 min service with (Blow Salon, Jill, Jill’s chair)
 
Return all start times for an appointment that has duration N (in min) for service Y (service class or superclass ID)
Return start times for a 30 min service men’s haircut for all service providers
 
Return all people/time-assets who are free for duration of N between day/time 1 and day/time 2
Given interval of 60 min in next 7 business days, who or what has at least one slot
